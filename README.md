# Jesus Youth Aluva - Whatsapp Automation
The project involves automating WhatsApp interactions using a cloud-based API and executing them through Postman. This automation allows users to programmatically send and receive messages, media, and perform various actions on WhatsApp using the cloud API's functionality. Postman, a popular API testing and automation tool, serves as the execution platform, enabling users to create and manage requests to the cloud API, simulate interactions, and observe responses. Overall, this project streamlines WhatsApp communication by leveraging cloud technology and automation tools for efficient and controlled messaging processes.
